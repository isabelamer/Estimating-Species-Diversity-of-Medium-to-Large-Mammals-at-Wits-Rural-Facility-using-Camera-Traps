# Estimating Species Diversity of Medium to Large Mammals at Wits Rural Facility using Camera-Traps

From camera trap data, a species accumulation curve can be used to extrapolate the number of individuals in the community. The aim of this experiment was to identify the minimum amount of camera traps necessary to confidently estimate the number of species present in Wits Rural Facility.

Methods:
Wits Rural Facility (WRF) is a campus of the University of the Witwatersrand, consisting of 350 hectares of bushveld woodland (The University of the Witwatersrand, 2017).  It is located on the Limpopo Province, close to the border with Mpumalanga. Situated at around 35 km from Kruger park, it is surrounded by private game reserves and ancestral homeland.

Camera trapping was conducted in September 2017. Collection lasted 10 days, from the 12th to the 21st.  Digital Bushell HD cameras containing 2GB SD cards were set to record videos of 30 seconds with a 1 second interval between consecutive triggers. There was a delay of around 3 seconds between triggering and shooting.
