# Estimating-Species-Diversity-of-Medium-to-Large-Mammals-at-Wits-Rural-Facility-using-Camera-Traps
From camera trap data, a species accumulation curve can be used to extrapolate the number of individuals in the community. The aim of this experiment is to identify the minimum amount of camera traps necessary to confidently estimate the number of species present in Wits Rural Facility.
